# nexmo-front-bridge
a bridge to send messages from front to 1 or many nexmo sms numbers... 
becaue nexmo does not have an intergration for front.. or vice versa :( 


using nodejs, express and some really light, simple routing


I deploy mine on heroku - buy beware, if you keep it 'out of idle' you will run out
of the free dyno at some point.. I found that out the real hard way..
